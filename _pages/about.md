I am Samuel, an applied mathematician with a PhD in mathematical modeling
and numerical simulation who is enthusiastic about everything that makes
machines intelligent!

I joined Google in January 2025 and have been part of the ML Red Team.

With the rest of my time, I enjoy traveling and hiking the Alps with my wife, and playing drums or guitar!
